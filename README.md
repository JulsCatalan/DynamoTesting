# Simple CRUD - DynamoDB SDK V3

## Educational Purposes Only

### Last Update: 20/08/2024

This repository is intended for educational purposes to explore the features of AWS DynamoDB using the new SDK V3. The project is still a work in progress, so I will continue adding new functions for testing in the future.

As expected, this repository does not include any `.env` or `node_modules` files. If you clone the repository, follow these steps to set it up:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <url-repo>
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure the `.env` file with the appropriate values for your AWS account, including the correct region for your DynamoDB.
4. In `app.js`, replace the "testing" and "testingId" placeholders with the keys you use for your database.
5. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

Feel free to contribute or experiment with the code as you learn more about DynamoDB!
